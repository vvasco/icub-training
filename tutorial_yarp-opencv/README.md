This second tutorial will guide you through integrating YARP with OpenCV while getting live image streams.

The task at hand is to correctly detect a red ball from images from a dataset streamed through a port.

Let's download following these simple steps:

```
$ cd /workspace
$ mkdir datasets && cd datasets
$ wget http://www.icub.org/download/software/datasetplayer-demo/testData_20120803_095402.zip
$ unzip testData_20120803_095402.zip
```
